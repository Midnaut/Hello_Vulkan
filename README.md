# Hello_Vulkan


Another Graphics Learning project, following https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

Really helping solidify the concepts of the modern stuff by seeing how dx12 and vulkan kind of feel like 2 sides of the same coin.

Seems more verbose right now compared to dx12, but a lot easier to understand thanks to the onboarding literature being a world better.

Hope this inspires your own exploration! enjoy.
